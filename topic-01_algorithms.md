# Topic 1: Algorithms

## Learning objectives

* Learn about tools you need to evaluate algorithms.
* Understand how algorithms perform.
* Compare and contrast different algorithms.
* Make a statement about the utility of a given algorithm to solve a particular problem. 

## What is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a set of steps that can be applied each time a given task or problem is encountered. Recipes, your morning routine, driving instructions, and lots of other things are algorithms. 

## What is algorithmic thinking?

**Algorithmic thinking** is about:

* Knowing that humans have learned to solve common problems well - that algorithms exist and you don't need to reinvent the wheel. 
* Being able to clearly define the problem at hand and select the optimal algorithm(s) for the task. 

Algorithmic thinking as a skill is way more valuable than the ability to write an algorithm in a given language. 

## Correctness

The key things we want in an algorithm are efficiency and correctness. The guidelines for **correctness** are: 

* The algorithm must have a clearly defined problem statement, input, and output.
* The steps of an algorithm are in a specific order.
* The steps of an algorithm are simple & explicit - there are no sub-steps.
* Each time we run the algorithm against all possible values of the input, we must always get the output we expect. 
* For any possible input, the algorithm must always end, and in a finite amount of time. 
* The algorithm should return the output, even if it's "none".

## Efficiency 

For an algorithm to be **efficient**, it must balance time and space complexities in a useful way. For example, an algorithm can be blazing fast, but require more memory than is available. To communicate an algorithm's efficiency, we use **Big O notation** - discussed in the next topic.
